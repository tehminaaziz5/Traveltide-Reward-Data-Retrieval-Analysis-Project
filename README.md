# Traveltide-Reward-Data-Retrieval-Analysis-Project
Master School Mastery Project

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer behavior on the TravelTide digital travel booking platform with the goal of supporting data-driven, personalized rewards and retention strategies. Using enriched session data and user-level aggregation, the analysis uncovers how engagement, booking behavior, discounts, trip characteristics, and spend patterns influence customer decisions.

The project follows a structured analytics workflow, progressing from session-level exploration to user-level profiling, and laying the foundation for customer segmentation and targeted marketing insights.

🎯 Objectives

Understand customer engagement patterns at the session level

Identify factors influencing booking and cancellation behavior

Analyze the role of discounts, trip distance, duration, and cost

Aggregate session data into meaningful user-level profiles

Generate actionable insights for marketing personalization and loyalty programs

🗂 Project Structure

The analysis is organized into three main parts:

Part 1: Session-Level Exploration

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature engineering (engagement, booking, trip, and cost features)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of sessions

Export of an enriched session-level dataset

Part 2: User-Level Aggregation

Aggregation of session data into user profiles

Analysis of engagement intensity, booking rates, discount sensitivity, and customer value

User-level exploratory visualizations

Part 3: Insights & Segmentation (Foundation)

Behavioral patterns supporting segmentation

Insights for personalized rewards and retention strategies

🔧 Key Features Engineered

Session duration and clicks per minute

Booking type and booking status

Trip start/end, duration, distance, and category

Discount usage and discount amount

Base trip cost and total trip cost

User age and account age

📊 Key Insights

Higher engagement (longer sessions and more clicks) is strongly associated with bookings

Discount users show greater variability and higher price sensitivity

Discounts play a supporting role rather than being the primary driver of bookings

A small group of users contributes disproportionately to overall value

Trip distance, duration, and spend meaningfully differentiate customer behavior

🧠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: Google Colab

Data: TravelTide sessions, flights, hotels, and users datasets

🚀 Outcomes

This project demonstrates how raw behavioral data can be transformed into actionable customer insights. The resulting user-level profiles and behavioral patterns provide a strong analytical foundation for customer segmentation, personalized marketing, and loyalty program design.
